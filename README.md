Templates for SmartDocs
===================

This repo contains the assets that are used to generate and render SmartDocs (interactive API documentation) for Apigee Edge. They are intended for use by Apigee customers, and while they are published here so they can be extended, they remain copyright of Apigee Corp.

The `/templates` directory contains the Handlebars templates for generating method docs and an index view for both the Apigee Edge Developer Portal (DefaultCMS…) and the standalone templates (DefaultIndex…).

The `/static` directory contains the JavaScript, CSS, and image assets that are also hosted on Apigee's CDN at smartdocs.apigee.com.
